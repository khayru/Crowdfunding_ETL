Extract, Transform, and load 
extract data from different resources 
transformed to clean datasets using Python, and Panda;  I clean the dataset by splitting one column into two columns, merging and dropping unwanted columns converting data and data type, and renaming columns 
after cleaning up the dataset it was saved in CSV files. I load the data into the database before that to create database schisms to organize and connect the relational database logically such as table names, the field with rows and columns, and data types. load CSV files into the Database using pgAdmin4 and run the query.
